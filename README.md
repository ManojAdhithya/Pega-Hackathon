## Inspiration
The inspiration of this project came when we tried to order a product from a very famous E-Commerce platform. The product was to be delivered by the courier service chosen by the E-Commerce platform. This created a lot of confusions as the details given to the seller were partial so it was hard to reach. Also the price for the courier service was also pre-defined. To clear these issues, We have developed an application, **Thoothanjal** where the user can select the courier service they want and decide the price for their service.

## What it does
With our application, The user can choose their courier service and receive the product. This helps the customer to choose the courier service which is good in thier area. The price also changes based on the courier service. So the customer can decide the service he needs.

## How we built it
We built it using Pega Dev Studio. Some important rules that we used includes SLA, Decision Table, Activities , Data Transform Etc.

## Challenges we ran into
The challegenges we faced were mainly when it comes to payment. The External payment website was very much cumbersome to connect to.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The main special feature of our application is that the customer places the order and the delivery partner gets the order. The Delivery Partner has to liberty to choose the date on which he can deliver. Other normal services just show the estimated elivery date without consulting the delivery partner, but the situations on that particular region might be bad that it might be hard to reach. When the delivery partner has the liberty, they can choose the delivery date based on the conditions of the locality.

## What we learned
We learned a lot of new things while working in this project. We learned how pega can be used in a very efficient way so that old methods of coding can be minimized.

## What's next for Thoothanjal
Thoothanjal can be integrated with an E Shopping Platform so the full efficiency of this application can be utilized.
